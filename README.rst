Python 3 module for partitioning water vapor and carbon dioxide fluxes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The `eddy covariance technique`__ is commonly used to measure gas fluxes
over agricultural fields. Greater insight into the functioning of
agroecosystems is possible if the measured gas fluxes can be separated
into their constitutive components: the water vapor flux into
transpiration and direct evaporation components, and the carbon dioxide
flux into photosynthesis and respiration components.

Features
========

* Implements the Scanlon and Sahu (2008) procedure for partitioning eddy
  covariance measurements of water vapor and carbon dioxide fluxes into
  stomatal (transpiration, photosynthesis) and nonstomatal (evaporation,
  respiration) components.

* Includes capabilities for applying basic QA/QC to high-frequency eddy
  covariance data, for correcting high frequency data for external
  fluctuations associated with air temperature and vapor density, and
  for estimating leaf-level water use efficiency.
